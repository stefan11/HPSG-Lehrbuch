% ALE never had support for "unfilling", at least in one reading of that term,
% until now.
%   But now it does.  We're not going to call it unfilling ,however, because
% that term has been so molested that it's going to confuse everyone.  We'll
% call it "sparse output."
%   To turn this on, use ale_flag(sparseoutput,_,on).

:- ale_flag(sparseoutput,_,on).


% newly defined in chart-display code
